              Edibubble, a visionary social enterprise, emerged from a student's profound concern for our planet's future. The journey commenced when Ryan Maudgalya delved into the far-reaching consequences of plastic water bottles as part of an assessment. His research highlighted the dire need for sustainable solutions, leading him to envision a world free from the shackles of plastic pollution. This seed of an idea germinated into a collective endeavor that birthed Edibubble.

              Originally conceived as a venture to create edible water bottles, the concept evolved through thoughtful consideration. Recognizing the readily available water resources at NIST, the team redirected their innovation towards a new horizonâ€”edible juice bottles. Inspired by the pioneering work of Ooho water, which ingeniously encapsulated water within edible spheres, Edibubble embarked on a mission to reshape the way we consume beverages.

              At its core, Edibubble is driven by a resolute mission: combating the pervasive pollution crisis. An astonishing 400 million tonnes of non-biodegradable plastic are discarded annually, wreaking havoc on our environment. Edibubble's mission is to counteract this menace by researching and crafting bio-friendly alternatives to conventional packaging. By offering innovative solutions, Edibubble aims to rejuvenate the delicate balance of our planet's ecosystem.
